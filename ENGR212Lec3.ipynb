    "When we use a cartesian coordinate system to describe the path of an object the unit vectors are constant. All the information about the movement of the object is contained in the functions that describe the magnitudes of each component. This coordinate system is independent of the path of the object and ALL the unit vectors are constant in direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the $\\hat{e}_n$ and $\\hat{e}_t$ system we consider that motion from the perspective of normal and tangential unit vectors which potentially change direction as they follow the path of the object. An important feature of the n/t coordinate system is that the instantaneous velocity is always in the direction of $\\hat{e}_t$ because of the way this coordinate system is structured. Both unit vectors are defined by the path of the object and are NOT necessarily constant in direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we consider the polar coordinate system where the unit vectors are independent of the path and NOT constant in direction. We will discuss later what might suggest how we choose among these coordinate systems in addressing a proble. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polar Coordinates and the Path:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we approach the description of motion in a polar coordinate system be sure to clarify in your mind the relationship between the path of the particle and the unit vectors. Many images you may find in various resources don't make this explicit. I like the image below because is clear about this relationship.\n",

    "Notice that the velocity vector is tangent to the path, the blue line, of the particle and we could describe it as $\\bar{v} = v \\hat{e}_t$. In the coordinate system with unit vectors $\\hat{e}_r$ and $\\hat{e}_{\\theta}$ the velocity vector will have components in both directions.\n",

    "$$\\large \\bar{r} = r\\hat{e}_r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about this for a moment. In math class we think of the location of a point in space in polar coordinates as being characterized by two values (r,$\\theta$) and yet here the location of the particle is described with just $\\bar{r} = r\\hat{e}_r$. There is NO component of $\\bar{r}$ in the $\\hat{e}_{\\theta}$ direction!! Part of the conceptual challenge here is that we have spend so much of our time, to this point, in the cartesian coordinate system, that our intuition is based on unit vectors that never change direction.\n",
